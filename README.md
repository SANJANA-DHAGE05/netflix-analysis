# Netflix Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Netflix titles dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about Netflix’s content library. The analysis focuses on aspects like genre distribution, release year trends, content types, movie durations, and the geographic origin of titles.

The goal is to use Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn within a Google Colab notebook to clean, analyze, and visualize Netflix’s catalog data, producing actionable insights and professional visualizations.

## Dataset

- The dataset, `netflix_titles.csv`, contains metadata for movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
- Key features include title, type (Movie or TV Show), release year, genre(s), duration, country, director, and more.
- Dataset source: [Add your dataset source URL here, e.g., Kaggle Netflix Dataset]

## Key Features of Analysis

- Data cleaning and preprocessing: removing duplicates, handling missing values, converting data types.
- Analysis of content types distribution (Movies vs TV Shows).
- Genre analysis using multi-label genre data.
- Visualizing trends in the number of titles released over years.
- Calculation and visualization of average movie durations.
- Exploring country-wise production trends.
- Additional advanced visualizations such as box plots, heatmaps, and pie charts.
- Well-documented markdown cells explaining each step and insight.

## Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- collections (Counter)
- Google Colab (development environment)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Upload the `netflix_titles.csv` file in the working directory or Google Colab environment.
3. Open the Jupyter/Colab notebook and run all cells sequentially.
4. Review markdown cells for detailed insights and explanations.
5. Modify or extend the analysis as needed for your own exploration.

## Sample Insights

- Dramas and Comedies are the most popular Netflix genres.
- Content releases grew rapidly from 2016 through 2019, peaking before a slowdown post-2020.
- Average movie duration is approximately 100 minutes.
- The United States, India, and the United Kingdom are the leading countries producing Netflix content.
